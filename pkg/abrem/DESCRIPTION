Description: This package applies some of the (technical) reliability methods, proposed in "The New Weibull Handbook", Fifth Edition by Dr. Robert B. Abernethy. It applies the Weibull (two- and three parameter) and Lognormal model on (life-)time observations, and calculates confidence bounds for B-lives using a variety of methods. It uses the 'prr' and 'pve' goodness-of-fit indicators (among others) for choosing the best model fit. Most calculation results (including the fits and confidence bounds) are summarized on Weibull or Lognormal probability paper. Full support for parameter contour plots are in development; currently Beta vs. Eta  plots are supported.
