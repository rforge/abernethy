Description: This package applies some of the (technical) reliability methods, proposed in "The New Weibull Handbook", Fifth Edition by Dr. Robert B. Abernethy. It applies the Weibull (two- and three parameter) and Lognormal model on (life-)time observations, and calculates confidence bounds for B-lives using a variety of methods. It uses the 'prr' goodness-of-fit indicator (among others) for choosing the best model fit. Most calculation results (including the fits and confidence bounds) are summarized on Weibull or Lognormal probability paper.
